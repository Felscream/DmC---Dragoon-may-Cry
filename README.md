DragoonMayCry is a plugin for Dalamud.

It tries to add flavour to the combat by implementing a "style" system inspired by the Devil May Cry series.

You fill your gauge by dealing damage, and progress between tiers depending on your damage output and execution.
Clipping your GCD or delaying it will penalize you.

THe plugin is now available for testing on the Dalamud Team repository.
