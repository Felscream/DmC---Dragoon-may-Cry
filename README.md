DragoonMayCry is a plugin for Dalamud.

It tries to add flavour to the combat by implementing a "style" system inspired by the Devil May Cry series.

You fill your gauge by dealing damage, and progress between tiers depending on your damage output and execution.
Clipping your GCD or delaying it will penalize you.

Values are currently unbalanced between jobs and only applicable to current content.

Can be installed using this custom repo `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Felscream/DalamudPlugins/main/repo.json` if you want to test it and give feedback
